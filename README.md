# FlintsShowdown
Flint's Showdown is a procedurally generated pseudo-simulation. It uses user-defined characters to write a story within a hunger-games-like scenario. Work on this is ongoing.

For those looking to contribute, I am happy to feature any approriate modifications to the main code or content packs that are sent my way.
